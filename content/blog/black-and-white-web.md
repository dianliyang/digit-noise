Designing without color is an exercise in brutal honesty. You cannot hide a poor layout behind a beautiful gradient. You cannot draw attention to a button simply by making it bright red.

When you restrict your palette to pure black and white, you are forced to use space, scale, and weight to establish hierarchy. A black and white website demands that the content be strong enough to stand on its own.

It's not a limitation; it's a focusing lens.
