In modern interface design, we are obsessed with providing options. We give users toggles, dropdowns, themes, and endless customization. But every option is a cognitive load. Every choice is a micro-decision that distracts from the core task.

When we design with extreme minimalism, we aren't just making things look clean. We are making decisions on behalf of the user so they don't have to. We are taking on the burden of choice.

## Typography as the Interface

When you strip away borders, backgrounds, and drop shadows, typography becomes the interface. The relationship between a header and body text isn't just about aesthetics; it's the only navigational cue the user has.

This is why choosing a legible, highly functional font is critical. It's not about being fancy; it's about pure communication. System fonts excel here because they have been optimized by OS creators for thousands of hours specifically for screen reading.
